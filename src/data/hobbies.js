export const aboutMe = [
  `I was previously working as a Clinical Pharmacist in General Practice.
  My duties involved supporting patients with medicines management and
  focused on long-term prescribing in specialised areas such as:
  Diabetes, Hypertension, and many more. In addition to my expanding
  knowledge in treating co-morbidities, I was able to develop
  fundamental transferable soft skills, such as communication,
  leadership, and most importantly accountability. I discovered tech by
  chance, through a business venture where I had to support a software
  engineer in creating my website. The process was intriguing and it
  encouraged me to look into coding via Codecademy and freecodecamp.
  What excited me most, was continuously facing new challenges and
  finding smart ways to solve problems. At the time I was looking to
  change careers, and the decision to pursue developing was
  straightforward. Shortly after, I was recruited by _nology. Through
  _nology's robust training program, I was able to produce various
  projects which can be seen on my projects page.`,
